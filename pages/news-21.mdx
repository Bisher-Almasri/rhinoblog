# Rhino PKG 2 out now (finally)!

Earlier this year, two of our team members took to the stage at FOSDEM to talk about some of the struggles that come with managing an open source project of our size. We reflected on some of our failures and successes, and left with a promise:

> We arenâ€™t letting go of the aforementioned projects that have been stalled. The rewrite of Rhino PKG and the release of our Unicons Icon pack are both still very much in the works and on the table.

As you may have seen in our [previous blog post](https://blog.rhinolinux.org), we announced that Rhino PKG 2 had entered testing. We are happy to say that testing has gone smoothly, and with some minor adjustments, Rhino PKG 2 is now officially ready for release!

## Highlights:

- Rhino PKG now has an updated display, with content organised into tables.
- The `--description/-d` flag will now display the description of the package.
- `rhino-pkg remove` now properly only shows installed packages, alongside a version number.
- Introduced a new command, `rhino-pkg sync` to update repositories without upgrading packages.
- All commands now have a shorthand available, check the wiki for more information.
- Packages will automatically be selected if there is only one option available.
- Classic snaps are now installable with Rhino PKG
- Packages installed with Pacstall no longer duplicate to show up as apt packages as well.

We recommend all users review the updated [Rhino PKG Wiki]().

Many thanks, and happy rolling

The Rhino Linux Team.
